1.	Perform zonal statistics (using exactextractr).
2.	Combine the results into a single data frame.
3.	Create faceted bar plots (using ggplot2) for each raster statistic.
4.	Generate choropleth maps (using ggplot2 and sf) to visualize spatial distributions.
5.	Suggest additional insights you might glean from these results.

Note: This example assumes:
•	A polygon shapefile (or other vector format) with a column named "continent" and a column (e.g., "country") indicating each country name.
•	You have multiple GeoTIFF files stored in a known directory.
•	You want to compute mean and median (commonly used statistics) for each polygon.
•	You can adapt the file paths, column names, or summary operations as needed for your actual data.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(sf)             # For reading and working with vector data
library(dplyr)          # For data manipulation
library(terra)          # For reading raster data (SpatRasters)
library(exactextractr)  # For zonal statistics
library(ggplot2)        # For plotting
library(forcats)        # For factor reordering
library(here)
```


# Load and Filter Polygons

```{r load polygons}

# Replace with the actual path to your polygon file (e.g., a shapefile)
poly <- st_read('/Users/rodriguez/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WorldWildlifeFund,Inc/Global_ES_mapping/global_poly_JJ.gpkg') 
# Load polygons as an sf objectpolygons_sf <- st_read(vector_path)

# Filter to retain only those features located in 'Latin America'
poly <- poly %>%
  filter(continent == "South America")
```

I am using the rasters with the modeled ES that represnet the same service for 1992 and 2020 in the same units (of course). There were not the ones originally prioritized and yhr ones i have been working on but a different set that is the only one that i can actually use


2. Load a List of GeoTIFF Rasters

```{r load raster es}
# Vector of raster file paths
inpath <- '/Users/rodriguez/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WorldWildlifeFund,Inc/Global_ES_mapping/Downloaded_data_ES2'
tiffes <- file.path(inpath, list.files(paste0(inpath),pattern= '1992.*\\.tif$'))
tiffes <- tiffes[-4]

prod <- basename(tiffes)


# Use terra::rast() to load each file as a SpatRaster object
rasters_list <- lapply(tiffes, rast)
```


Explanation:
Specify a list of file paths to our GeoTIFFs.
•	Setting names(rasters_list) helps keep track of which raster is which.

3. Compute Zonal Statistics with exactextractr
```{r compute stats}
# We'll compute mean and median as an example
target_stats <- c("mean", "median")

# exact_extract can append columns from the polygon layer;
# here, we assume 'country' is a column in polygons_latin_america
results_list <- lapply(rasters_list, function(r) {
  # Perform exact extraction
  # - append_cols = "country" retains the country identifier with each result
  res <- exact_extract(r, poly,
                       fun = target_stats,
                       append_cols = "name_long")
  r_name <- names(r)
  
  # Add a column labeling which raster these results are from
  res$raster_name <- r_name
  return(res)
})

# Combine results from all rasters into one data frame
zonal_df <- do.call(rbind, results_list)

# Optional: rename columns for clarity:
zonal_df <- zonal_df %>%
  rename(
    mean_value   = mean, 
    median_value = median
  )

# Show a snippet of the combined results
head(zonal_df)
```

Explanation:
  •	exact_extract() returns a data frame (or list of data frames) with the requested summary statistics for each polygon.
•	We loop through each raster, compute the same statistics, and store them in results_list.
•	We bind all partial results together into zonal_df for easy plotting and analysis.

4. Create Faceted Bar Plots

We want separate bar plots (facets) for each raster, showing (for instance) mean or median ecosystem service values by country, sorted from high to low.

# For demonstration, let's use median_value.
ggplot(zonal_df, aes(
  x = fct_reorder(country, median_value, .desc = TRUE), 
  y = median_value
)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ raster_name, scales = "free_x") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Median Ecosystem Service Values by Country",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Median Value"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

Explanation:
  •	fct_reorder(country, median_value, .desc = TRUE) reorders the countries from highest to lowest median.
•	facet_wrap(~ raster_name) creates a separate panel for each raster.
•	coord_flip() swaps the axes, making country names more readable (optional).

Tip
•	You can similarly create a bar plot for mean_value by substituting mean_value in the aesthetic mapping.

5. Generate Choropleth Maps

Use ggplot2 and the spatial geometry from our sf object to color each polygon by its statistic of interest. Faceting again by each raster is useful to compare spatial patterns.

# First, merge the zonal_df results back into the polygon sf object.
# This ensures each polygon gets a corresponding mean/median value.

# We need a unique identifier. 
# Assuming 'country' is unique per polygon, we can do a left_join:
map_data <- polygons_latin_america %>%
  left_join(zonal_df, by = "country")

# Plot the median_value as an example
ggplot(map_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = median_value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ raster_name) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", na.value = "gray90") +
  labs(
    title = "Choropleth of Median Ecosystem Services",
    fill = "Median Value"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

Explanation:
  •	We left_join() to attach the computed statistics (per country) back onto the spatial object.
•	geom_sf(aes(fill = median_value)) shades polygons by the median.
•	facet_wrap(~ raster_name) again yields a panel for each raster.
•	scale_fill_viridis_c() is a popular scale for continuous data, but you can choose others.

6. Additional Insights & Suggestions
	•	Statistical Range: In addition to mean/median, you might compute minimum, maximum, standard deviation, or other metrics that provide insight into variability.
	•	Comparisons Across Regions: Summaries of how different countries or regions rank across multiple rasters can highlight hotspots for restoration potential or areas of concern.
	•	Temporal Analyses: If the rasters represent different timeframes, you could compare historical vs. current vs. projected ecosystem services.
	•	Spatial Correlation: You might check if certain ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage vs. water retention) are positively or negatively correlated across the study area.
	•	Further Plot Customizations: You could apply custom color palettes, dynamic labeling, or interactive mapping (e.g., using tmap or leaflet) for better stakeholder communication.

Final Remarks
	•	This script serves as a template you can adapt to your needs:
	•	Change file paths, column names, or the specific statistics.
	•	Modify or extend the plotting code (e.g., to generate boxplots, heatmaps, or more advanced visualizations).
	•	Integrate additional data (socioeconomic indicators, climate layers, etc.) for enriched analyses.

With these steps, you’ll be able to load, process, and visualize polygon-level statistics from multiple raster datasets, facilitating comparisons and decision-making for ecosystem assessments in Latin America—or any region of interest.
