# Goals
- Share current status
- Get feedback on approach & priorities

# Data & Processing
- Inputs (rasters, 10km grid)
- Change metrics (abs, pct)
- Hotspot rules (vectors/explicit; thresholds)

# Methods Overview
- Hotspot extraction (diagram)
- Mapping/masking
- Distributional comparisons (KS, AUC, δ)

# Key Results (selected)
- KS heatmap (service × variable)
- ECDF panels (GDP, POP)
- Density overlays (2–3 services)

# Early Takeaways
- People-facing services cluster nearer population/economy
- Pollination hotspots skew rural/natural

# Decisions / Next Steps
- Figure shortlist
- Sensitivity checks
- Writing plan & assignments
