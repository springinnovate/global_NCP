# LOAD THE DATA


# Organize columns

I had to do this to make sense of the different runs i have done and the data that i need. From individual yearly stats (which ones?) ["raw" data rasters and derived raster algebra products] bi-temporal relative change, key attributes from the input data among others. Need to come out with a better way to do this, and eventually keep a final gpkg correctly organized, but it is always better to have the workflow take care of the whole thing on its own. Have to spend less time here , can repeat the process easier and with fewer errors.

# Load latest version and inckude usle data 

```{r load input polygon data cumaribo}

#Builds a list of files in the vector directory
inpath <- '/Users/rodriguez/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WorldWildlifeFund,Inc/global_NCP/data/vector'
sets <- file.path(inpath, list.files(inpath, pattern = "hydrosheds.*\\.gpkg$"))
# Set and select an index to load the desired dastaset
t <- 1
set <- sets[t]
lyr <- st_layers(set)
# # load polygons
print(lyr)
```





```{r  get this sorted}
bas <- st_read(set)

## Add broader info spatial units 
Here, we will add the names of the broader spatial units:

country
WWF biome
Ecoregion


This part is a mess and kind of embarrassing, i need to clean it a bit. But this is a great piece of thinking. I get for each basin the country for which the larger share belongs and assign it to that country, s i get the attribes (id of coutnries, biomnes ,ecoregions and can jopin it to the hydrosheds as additional attributes. We are going to sue this soon, but again, there is some cleaning to do here. I just don't have time now. 

```{r join spatial unit names}

inpath <- here('vector')
# Load a the vecor with the basins

# Drop unnecessary columns (optional)
basins <- basins[c(1:13)]


# load vector with the countries
cnt <- st_read(here('vector', 'cartographic_ee_ee_r264_correspondence.gpkg'))
# drop unnecesary columns
cnt <- cnt[c(1,12,22)]

# Reproject both layers to an equal area crs (to make sure the we are correctly calculating the areas withing the polygons)
cnt <- st_transform(cnt, crs = "EPSG:6933")
bas_eq <- st_transform(basins, crs = "EPSG:6933")

# Create a template to rasterize the vector data
template <- terra::rast(bas_eq, resolution = 300)

# Rasterize the spatial unit polygons
r_country <- terra::rasterize(vect(cnt), template, field = "id")

# Step 2: Extract coverage fraction for each basin
country_weights <- exactextractr::exact_extract(r_country, basins, weights = "area")

# Step 3: For each basin, find the country with max coverage

Here, we are loading the data with the LCchange calucalted to join with the basins. We jsut want to know each basinb to whci country mayorly blongs (horrible writing, work on that later)

################## THIS IS VERY IMPPORTAnt. Instead of struggling  with the multiple dataframes, it is easier to load the vector file swith all the column and pivot longer as necessary. Easier to manage, adjust on the fly!
plt <- as_tibble(plt %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(ends_with("pct_ch")),  # Select all columns ending with "pct_ch"
    names_to = "service",        # New column to store the service names

plt <- left_join(plt,cd) # this will return an error because maybe the cd dataframe is not there. It is the one thatdefiens the class names and colors 
plt <- plt%>% filter(!is.na(pct_ch))
```

I remember here. plt is used as input in the visualizations.Rmd notebook. That might not be the smartest way to do this, but anyway, what we need to have is a final datafrasme that we are going to process. The dataframe is the despatialzied basins object pivoted long, so we can use ggplot2 and dplyr tools to extract insights. The next point from here, 04/05/2025 is to extract the summary metrics for the additional rasters,  contact the techniocal group, share the updated data and update the documentation (i already updated main`)

We are not using  this. This os from an older verion by country. 
We could actually get all the metrics for all the classes for all the years for all the basins and feed the whole thing into some well designed ML model. It might tell us something, or be useful in some measure. and then add a temporal component and animate the scatterplots or something. Group them by country. By income level. by biome. All that would be possible, Need to think with wome calm about this.
Add some charts/amimatiosn that shows the lc dinamics over time. This could be group in multiple ways. I can't think whcih would be the best way to start, but we have everytting we need.
