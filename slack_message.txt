Hi team,

A quick update on our analysis outputs:

To keep our repository cleaner and manage larger data files more efficiently, some key outputs are now being written directly to our shared processed data directory.

*All these files can be found in:* `/home/jeronimo/data/global_ncp/processed`

Here's a breakdown of what's there:

1.  *`s_results_hot_vs_non.csv`*:
    *   **What it is:** This CSV contains the full results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. It compares hotspot versus non-hotspot distributions for various socio-environmental variables across different ecosystem services. It includes KS D-statistics, p-values, adjusted p-values, and effect sizes.
    *   **Why it's useful:** It's the primary output for understanding which covariates most strongly distinguish hotspot cells, suitable for external review, meta-analysis, or further statistical interpretation.

2.  *`plt_long.rds` (and `plt_long.feather` if Python `arrow` is used)*:
    *   **What it is:** This is the canonical long-format table (`plt_long`) containing all per-cell, per-service change metrics and associated socio-environmental covariates. It serves as the primary input for hotspot and KS analyses.
    *   **Why it's useful:** It's a cached, pre-processed dataset that speeds up subsequent analyses and ensures consistency across different scripts. The `.rds` is for R users, and `.feather` offers broader compatibility (e.g., Python `pandas`).

3.  *`_hotspots_index.csv` (located within `/home/jeronimo/data/global_ncp/processed/hotspots/`)*:
    *   **What it is:** An index file that lists all generated hotspot vector layers (`.gpkg` files), detailing their scope (global/subregional), grouping column, value, metric (absolute or percentage change), and the number of hotspots identified.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Helps to quickly locate and understand the content of the individual hotspot geospatial files without having to browse through all subdirectories.

4.  *`hotspots_*.gpkg` (located within `/home/jeronimo/data/global_ncp/processed/hotspots/{abs|pct}/{global|<group_col>}/`)*:
    *   **What it is:** These are GeoPackage (GPKG) files containing the actual geospatial data (vector layers) of identified hotspot cells. They are generated for both absolute and percentage change metrics, globally and for various subregions (e.g., by income group, continent).
    *   **Why it's useful:** These files are designed for direct use in GIS software (like QGIS) for mapping, visualization, and further geospatial analysis of hotspots.

Please reach out if you have any questions!
