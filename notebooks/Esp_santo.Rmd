# 1. Introduction

This report presents a preliminary approach to estimate potential ecosystem service gains derived from restoration in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The analysis is conducted at a spatial resolution of 30 meters.


```{r prep environment, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
packs <- c('terra', 'purrr', 'landscapemetrics', 'sf','dplyr',
           'here', 'gdalUtilities', 'jsonlite', 'devtools', 'stringr',
           'parallel', 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'ggplot2', 'janitor', 'forcats', 'foreign')
sapply(packs, require, character.only = TRUE, quietly=TRUE)
rm(packs)
align_rasters <- function(raster_list, template, resample_method = "bilinear") {
  lapply(raster_list, function(r) {
    if (!compareGeom(r, template, stopOnError = FALSE)) {
      message("Aligning raster: ", names(r))
      # Resample to align with the template
      resample(r, template, method = resample_method)
    } else {
      # Return raster as is if already aligned
      message("Raster already aligned: ", names(r))
      r
    }
  })
}

normalize_raster <- function(r) {
  min_val <- min(values(r), na.rm = TRUE)
  max_val <- max(values(r), na.rm = TRUE)
  (r - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
}

process_intervention_area <- function(raster_list) {
  # Normalize each raster in the list
  normalized_rasters <- lapply(raster_list, normalize_raster)
  # Combine the normalized rasters by summing them
  combined_raster <- do.call(sum, normalized_rasters)
  return(combined_raster)
}
```

## 1.2 Objectives

This analysis has two objectives:
- Identify high-value pixels for restoration purposes.
- Estimate potential gains in ecosystem service (ES) provision if a target area (preliminarily 30,200 ha) is restored to natural vegetation within the State of Espírito Santo.

## 1.3 Theoretical Assumptions

This analysis is based on the following assumptions:

- All ecosystem services are equally valuable.
- Restoration likelihood is distributed uniformly across the intervention areas.
- The restoration target area is 30,200 ha. The exact location of restoration efforts within the state is not yet determined, as it depends on factors such as:
  - The willingness of landowners and managers to participate in the project.
  - The ability to secure control over land during the project duration.
  - The spatial configuration effects incorporated during the modeling of ecosystem service gains.
  - Confidence intervals provide robust estimates under random distribution scenarios.

# 2. Materials and Methods

## 2.1 Study Area

This analysis encompasses the totality of Espírito Santo State, located on the Brazilian Atlantic coast. A more detailed contextualization of the region, including its geographic, environmental, demographic, and economic aspects, and how it integrates into the broader Symbiosis project can be included here. For this exercise, the total area to restore is 30,200 ha.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.2 Input Data

-   **Ecosystem Service Data:** Chaplin-Kramer et al. (2022) [Mapping the planet’s critical natural assets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01934-5). Data were derived using InVEST, a suite of spatially explicit models that map and quantify nature's contributions to people. InVEST was developed by the Natural Capital Project, a partnership among Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund

-   **Restoration Potential:** [Adjusted Griscom restoration grided data](https://zenodo.org/records/883444)

Spatial grids (raster data in GeoTIFF format) were used, where pixel values reflect estimated gains, measured in units specific to each ecosystem service. These gains represent the potential increase in ecosystem service provision if an area is restored to its potential natural vegetation, except for urban/built-up areas. The following ecosystem services were considered:

1.  Coastal Protection. Unitless measure, refers to a derived vulnerability index. [**InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model**](https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-userguide/latest/en/coastal_vulnerability.html)

2.  Nitrogen Export. Derived from the Nitrogen retention modeled using the [**InVEST Nutrient Delivery Ratio**](http://data.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-releases/3.5.0/userguide/ndr.html).
    Expressed in kg/pixel/year

3.  Sediment Retention. Derived using [**InVEST SDR: Sediment Delivery Ration**](https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-userguide/latest/en/sdr.html).
    Values in ton/pixel/year

4.  Pollination. Derived from [**InVEST SDR: Pollinator Abundance Model**](https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-userguide/latest/en/croppollination.html).
    Units represent Polllination Change in people fed on HABitat. More information in
    [**Chaplin-Kramer, et al.
    2022**](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41559-022-01934-5/MediaObjects/41559_2022_1934_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)

5.  Nature Access represented as [**the number of people within 1 hour travel of natural and semi-natural lands**](https://github.com/springinnovate/distance-to-hab-with-friction) (Chaplin-Kramer et al,
    2022).


## 2.3 Processing Environment 

Spatial Raster Processing Tools: The `terra`, `dplyr`, and `sf` packages in **R** were used for analysis. Data visualization was performed using `ggplot2`.

### 2.4 Normalization of Ecosystem Service Restoration Data 

Raster data were normalized using the following formula to bring values to a common standard:
$$
\text{Normalized Value} = \frac{\text{Raster Value} - \text{Min Value}}{\text{Max Value} - \text{Min Value}}
$$

Where: 
- $\text{Raster Value}$ is the value of a given pixel. 
- $\text{Min Value}$ and $\text{Max Value}$ represent the minimum and maximum observed values across the raster dataset.

# 2.5 Stratified Random Sampling to Estimate Total Ecosystem Service Gains

A stratified random sampling approach was employed to estimate total gains in ES service provision given a total intervention area of 30,200 ha. The model can be refined by incorporating additional parameters, such as minimum distance to boundaries, distance between points, topography, or inhabited areas. By definition, coastal risk protection only occurs at the coast; and this has to be kept in mind for example by setting sampling weights for the different  services or derived from population density data. This approach provides a distribution of possible values and allows for the calculation of confidence intervals. By synthesizing the results from multiple repetitions, the estimates are less susceptible to individual sample variations.

# 2.6 Data Alignment

All raster datasets were aligned to the same spatial resolution, coordinate reference system (CRS), and origin. The global ESA Land Cover Classification Raster for 2020 (CRS: WGS-84) was used as a template. The final results were then reprojected to the South America Albers Equal Area Conic CRS


### 3.2.3 Prepare Templates to Align the Data

To perform the analysis, all the raster datasets need to be brought to the same spatial resolution, crs and aligned  to the same origin. We used the global ESA Land Cover Classification Raster for 2020 (CRS: WGS-84)

```{r create tmp, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(here)
# add backgrounds/templates to align 
path_lc <- here('ESA_LC') 
# load reclassified land cover map
tf <- file.path(path_lc, list.files(path_lc, pattern= "Rec"))
lc <- lapply(tf,rast)
lc <- lc[[1]]
# create rcl matrix
rcl <- matrix(c(
  0, Inf, 0   # Any value greater than 0 becomes 1
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

#create background pixels, subsitute all by 0
tmp <- lapply(lc, function(r){
  r <- classify(r[[1]], rcl)
})
tmp <- tmp[[1]]
rm(lc)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4 Processing

## 4.1 Target Layers
The target layers used for this analysis were: Coastal Protection, Nitrogen Export, Sediment Retention, and Pollination.
```{r select ES diff  data, include=FALSE}
#Restoration:
area <-c("BRAZIL", "MEXICO") 


tiffes <- file.path(
  here("cropped_raster_data"),
  list.files(
    here("cropped_raster_data"),
    pattern = "MEXICO,*\\.tif$"
  )
)
tiffes <- tiffes[c(1,11,15,18,22)] #just keep pollination - HAB,
#tiffes <- tiffes[-2]
```

## 4.2 Normalization and Combination of Ecosystem Service Provision Gains 

The target layers were normalized and combined into a single raster. This raster serves as a proxy for total ES provision, assuming all services are equally valuable. This approach allows for the identification of the spatial distribution of potential ecosystem service gains. Nature Access was excluded from this combined layer because its pixel values represent the number of people who gain access to each pixel, which could result in counting the same people multiple times if multiple pixels are restored near each other.

```{r apply mask AOI AP, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Step 1: Extract file names, product names, and country names
file_names <- basename(tiffes)  # Extract file names from paths

# Extract product names and country names
product_names <- sub("_[A-Z]+\\.tif$", "", file_names)  # Remove "_COUNTRY.tif" to get product name
country_names <- sub(".*_(.*?)\\.tif$", "\\1", file_names)  # Extract country name from file name

# Step 2: Create a dataframe to organize the information
file_info <- data.frame(
  FilePath = tiffes,
  Product = product_names,
  Country = country_names,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Step 3: Sort the dataframe by Country first, then by Product
file_info <- file_info %>%
  arrange(Country, Product)

# Step 4: Extract the sorted file paths
tiffes <- file_info$FilePath

baseES <- lapply(tiffes, rast)

tmp <- crop(tmp, baseES[[1]])
 

baseES <- lapply(baseES, function(r) {
  if (!compareGeom(r, tmp, stopOnError = FALSE)) {
    message("Aligning raster: ", names(r))
    resample(r, tmp, method = "bilinear")
    } else {
      message("Raster already aligned: ", names(r))
      r
      }
    })
#### This is only necessary if we are working with a subset of the area, need to extract by a smaller polygon. Right now we only need that for Espirito Santo
# poly <- st_read(here("Interventions", "Brazil_int_areas", "Espirito_Santo_Albers.shp"))
# pol_wgs <- st_transform(poly, crs=crs(baseES[[1]]))
# serv_bra <- lapply(baseES, function(r){
#   r <- crop(r,pol_wgs)
#   r <- mask(r, pol_wgs)
#   }) 
# 
# # ust assign this vrariable name, sowe don't need to edit the whole thing 
serv_bra <- baseES

serv_bra <- lapply(serv_bra,normalize_raster)
serv_bra <- do.call(c, serv_bra)

tmp <- mask(tmp, pol_wgs)
tmp <- trim(tmp)

serv_bra  <- merge(serv_bra , tmp)
    
    # Sum the layers of the merged raster
    serv_bra  <- app(serv_bra, sum)

writeRaster(serv_bra, paste0(here("restoration_combined"),'/', 'BRA_ES_sum2.tif'))
```


## 4.3 Optimization to Identify Priority Areas

Pixels representing the highest aggregated ES gains were extracted from the combined raster, totaling 30,200 ha, to identify priority areas for restoration. This optimization process represents a second run of the analysis and considers the combined value of Coastal Protection, Nitrogen Export, Sediment Retention, and Pollination.

## 4.4 Sampling and Synthesis of Results
Stratified random sampling was performed on the optimized raster to estimate the expected restoration gains, assuming randomly selected pixels are extracted from the potential restoration areas. This initial assessment provides insight into potential ES gains associated with the restoration efforts.

```{r sampling target areas brazil, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

  0, Inf, 1   # Any value from 0 to Infinity becomes 1

                              values = TRUE) 

  # Remove rows where ALL values are NA
  sample_values <- sample_values[rowSums(is.na(sample_values)) != ncol(sample_values), ]

  # If not enough samples after removing NAs, resample
  if (nrow(sample_values) < pixels_needed) {
    sample_values <- rbind(
      sample_values,
      spatSample(raster, size = pixels_needed - nrow(sample_values),
                 method = "random", na.rm = TRUE, 
                 as.points = FALSE, xy = FALSE, values = TRUE)
    )
  }

    lower_ci <- mean_val - margin_error
    upper_ci <- mean_val + margin_error
    return(c(mean = mean_val, lower_ci = lower_ci, upper_ci = upper_ci))
  })
