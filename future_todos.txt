Here are the future tasks we identified:

1.  **Adapt analysis for multi-temporal data:** Adapt analysis to handle updated modeled ES layers and multiple points in time (beyond bi-temporal T0, T1). Strategize for incorporating multi-temporal data.
2.  **Quantify hotspot vs. non-hotspot change:** Develop a method to quantify and visualize the share of total change (from bar plots) that occurs within hotspots versus outside of them, possibly using stacked bar plots.
