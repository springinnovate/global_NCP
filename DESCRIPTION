Description: 
    ESZonalR is an R package designed to systematically extract, analyze, and visualize 
    zonal statistics from global ecosystem service raster datasets. It provides tools for 
    computing summary statistics for various spatial units (e.g., countries, watersheds, 
    biomes), integrating extracted values into polygon datasets, and generating meaningful 
    bar plots and maps. The package supports multi-year comparisons, facilitating the 
    detection of spatial and temporal changes in ecosystem service provision.
