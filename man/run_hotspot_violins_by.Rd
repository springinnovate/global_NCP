}
\arguments{
\item{df_long}{Long-form change table (\code{plt_long} style).}

\item{group_col}{Column name to facet by (string).}

\item{loss, gain}{Character vectors of services treated as losses / gains.}

\item{pct_cutoff}{Numeric cutoff (e.g., 0.05) passed to \code{extract_hotspots_by()}.}

\item{threshold_mode}{Threshold interpretation (passed through).}

\item{svc_order}{Optional service ordering; defaults to factor levels in \code{df_long}.}

\item{cut_q}{Trim quantile for violin plotting.}

\item{plot_n}{Max rows sampled for plotting (to keep files manageable).}

\item{keep_only_ordered}{Keep only services in \code{svc_order}.}

\item{out_root}{Directory root for plots (defaults to \code{out_plots()}).}
}
\value{
List with \code{abs_plot} and \code{pct_plot} invisibly; also writes PNGs.
